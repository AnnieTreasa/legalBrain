Three  years  \non, I believe we are on course. In the intervening period, much \nhas happened in the legal world.

Legal institutions and \nlawyers  are  at  a  crossroads,  I  claim,  and  will  change  more  radi-\ncally  in  less  than  two  decades  than  they  have  over  the  last  two  \ncenturies. If you are a young lawyer, this revolution will happen \non your watch.\n‘Young’ should be construed broadly, applying to students who \nare contemplating a job in law through to newly promoted part-\nners in firms who are wondering how their careers might unfold. \nI also write for those who are interested in young legal businesses, \nsuch  as  the  legaltech  start-  ups  and  the  new-  look  law  firms  that  \nare now seeking to redefine the legal marketplace.\nTo  elder  statesmen  in  traditional  firms,  who  may  feel  after","metadata":{"source":"docs/Tomorrowlawyers.pdf"}},{"pageContent":"such  as  the  legaltech  start-  ups  and  the  new-  look  law  firms  that  \nare now seeking to redefine the legal marketplace.\nTo  elder  statesmen  in  traditional  firms,  who  may  feel  after  \na  couple  of  paragraphs  that  they  are  excused  from  reading  on,  \nI  issue  a  warning.  Although  it  may  appear  that  the  future,  and  \nparticularly the topic of technology, is of interest primarily to the \nnext generation, some of the transformations that I discuss here \nare coming in the next few years. Unless retirement is imminent, \nwhat  I  say  here  will  directly  affect  older  lawyers  too.  More  than  \nthis,  leaders  in  the  legal  profession  today  should  be  concerned  \nnot just about hanging on until their pensions click in, but about \ntheir long- term legacy as well.","metadata":{"source":"docs/Tomorrowlawyers.pdf"}},{"pageContent":"xviii Introduction\n‘My  call  is  to  the  young  in  heart,  regardless  of  age’,  John  \nF. Kennedy once said, and I say this again now.

Since  then,  I  have  written  a  \ndoctorate in law and computers at Oxford University, and worked \nfor several years with one of the ‘Big 4’ accounting firms, and then \nfor  much  of  the  1990s  with  an  international  law  firm,  on  whose  \nboard I sat for three years. I have been a law professor for 25 years, \nand,  for  20  years,  an  independent  adviser  to  law  firms,  in-  house  \nlegal departments, governments, and judiciaries around the world.\nEven my fiercest critics will concede that in my numerous books \nand  newspaper  columns  over  the  last  30  years  I  have  been  right  \nmore often than wrong in my predictions.

The first is an updated, \nsimplified restatement of my views on the future of legal services, \nas  presented  in  four  other  works—  The  Future  of  Law  (1996),  \nTransforming the Law (2000), The End of Lawyers?

There are managers within \nsmall  or  medium-  sized  businesses,  who  have  properties  to  \nrent,  employees  to  engage,  and  all  manner  of  regulations  with  \nwhich  to  comply.  And  there  are  individual  citizens,  who  may  \nneed  legal  help  with  such  matters  as  moving  house,  coping  \nwith  debt,  or  pursuing  some  personal  injury  claim.  Although  \ndiverse in nature, these clients currently share a big challenge— \ngenerally,  they  cannot  afford  legal  services  when  delivered  in  \nthe traditional way.\nGeneral  Counsel,  the  individuals  who  run  in-  house  legal  \ndepartments,  invariably  say  that  they  face  three  problems.

Second, \nthey are being asked by their chief executives, chief finance offi-\ncers,  and  boards  to  reduce  the  amount  they  spend  on  external  \nlaw  firms.  And  yet,  at  the  same  time,  third,  they  say  they  have  \nmore legal and compliance work to undertake than ever before; \nand  that  the  work  is  riskier  too.  Many  General  Counsel  tell  me  \nthat they are being required to reduce their overall legal budgets \nby  between  30  per  cent  and  50  per  cent.

Small  businesses  face  a  similar  dilemma.  These  \ntraders  do  not  have  their  own  specialist  in-  house  lawyers,  and  \nwhenever  they  are  in  need  of  serious  legal  help,  they  must  cur-\nrently  turn  to  external  law  firms.  In  these  demanding  times,  \nhowever,  many  business  people  confess  that  they  cannot  afford  \nlawyers  and  often  have  to  run  the  risk  of  working  without  legal  \nguidance.

The more- for- less challenge will, I expect, \nirreversibly change the way that lawyers work.\nLiberalization\nThe second main driver of change is liberalization. A little back-\nground  should  help  here.  In  most  countries,  historically  and  \ngenerally  speaking,  only  qualified  lawyers  have  been  permitted  \nto provide legal services to clients, and, even then, only from spe-\ncific  types  of  organization  (typically  from  partnerships).  Laws  \nand  regulations  have  stipulated  who  can  be  a  lawyer,  who  can  \nrun and own a legal business, and what services they can provide. \nDifferent countries have drawn lines in different places, so that,","metadata":{"source":"docs/Tomorrowlawyers.pdf"}},{"pageContent":"6 Three Drivers of Change\n       \nin England and Wales, what is known as ‘reserved’ legal business \n(work that only qualified lawyers are permitted to undertake) is \na narrower category than the ‘authorized practice of law’, as it is \nknown in the US. But the principles underlying the exclusivity of \nlawyers are similar in most jurisdictions; and the pivotal justifica-\ntion is that it is in clients’ interests that those who advise them on \nthe law are suitably trained and experienced. Just as we would not \nwant any Joe performing brain surgery on us, then, similarly, we \nshould not wish that same Joe representing us in the courtroom.\nBut  one  big  problem  here  is  that  this  closed  community  of  \nlegal  specialists  does  not  seem  to  offer  sufficient  choice  to  the  \nconsumer.

In turn, \nmost  law  firms  proposed  a  variety  of  alternative  fee  arrange-\nments  (AFAs)  while  also  making  many  lawyers  (from  junior  \nlawyers through to partners) and support staff redundant, and \nspending less on back- office functions such as technology and \nmarketing.\nIn truth, most in- house legal departments and law firms were \neager  during  this  stage  of  denial  to  weather  the  storm  without  \nmajor upheaval: in- house lawyers hoped to maintain their head-\ncount,  while  law  firms  strove,  through  (non-  fundamental)  cuts,","metadata":{"source":"docs/Tomorrowlawyers.pdf"}},{"pageContent":"major upheaval: in- house lawyers hoped to maintain their head-\ncount,  while  law  firms  strove,  through  (non-  fundamental)  cuts,  \nto maintain their profitability.\nDuring this first stage, some law firms engaged in tokenism of \na  kind—  they  partook  of  some  modest  alternative  sourcing,  but  \nlargely as a matter of show.

At the same time, they are right to recognize that what \nis  planned  is  very  much  a  first  generation  set-  up.

The key characteristic of these systems is that some of the \ndispute resolution process is, in one way or another, taken on by \nthe system itself.\nAn early and much touted example was Cybersettle, a Web- \nbased system launched in 1998.

These  amounts  \nwere  not  disclosed  but  if  the  two  ranges  overlapped,  a  settle-\nment  could  be  achieved,  the  final  figure  usually  being  a  split  \ndown the middle.\nAnother sort of more ambitious ODR is mediation across the \nWeb. An online mediation can be undertaken when face- to- face \nmediation is logistically difficult, perhaps because of the locations \nof the parties or when, relative to the size of dispute, it is too costly \nto assemble.
